# yandex_practicum-user-behavior-and-AAB-test-analysis
In this project we will analyze data of an online store that sells food. We will check the users funnel and see how many users make the entire journey from the main screen to the payment screen, and how many are quit in the middle or at the beginning.  Also, we will check the results of an A/A/B test that checks whether changing the fonts for the entire app will change the users' behavior and increase revenues or not.

The libraries and modules that had being used in this project are as follows: 
1. pandas
2. sidetable
3. math
4. scipy
5. datetime
6. seaborn
7. matplotlib.pyplot
8. plotly.express
